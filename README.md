# I don want to pay to reject cookies (Didomi Consent modal remover)

For all of us, our Internet experience has been marked by the invasion of cookies, these small files that record our activities and preferences on the web. I understand the need for these things to offer personalized services, and I oppose the growing practice of paying users to reject them.

The right to privacy is fundamental and should not be a reserved privilege for those who can afford it. Paying to reject cookies creates an unfair digital divide and favors the monetization of our personal data. This is an abuse that we cannot allow.
